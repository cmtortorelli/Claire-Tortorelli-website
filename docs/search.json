Understanding how wildfires influence future fires may help\r\nmanagers utilize these burned areas in future fire planning efforts.\r\nAt UC Davis, I am working with Drs. Andrew Latimer and Derek Young to\r\ninvestigate the drivers of reburn severity and predict areas where past\r\nfires may help reduce future fire severity to inform management actions\r\nusing remotely sensed data and field observations.\r\nPost-fire forest\r\nrecovery - California forests\r\nThe amount of forested land burning in severe fire is increasing at\r\nan alarming rate. Forest recovery after severe fire is a top management\r\nconcern, given that many of these areas appear to have undergone\r\ntransitions from forest to non-forest shrubland or grassland following\r\nsevere fire. However, many post-fire regeneration surveys occur < 5\r\nyears following fire, and these conditions may not accurately predict\r\nhow forests are recovering in the long term.\r\nWorking with a team at UC Davis, I am using long-term post-fire\r\nmonitoring data to investigate how forests are recovering after fire\r\nover time, and what factors may be influencing this recovery. How well\r\ndo regeneration and site conditions shortly after fire predict longer\r\nterm recovery patterns?\r\nWildfire and\r\nPlant Invasions - Intermountain West\r\nInvasion by non-native grasses are particularly impactful when they\r\nalter fire regimes and promote fire in historically fire-resistant\r\nareas, resulting in the loss of plant species that do not recover\r\nquickly after burning.\r\nI use field data, remote sensing, and fire simulations to examine how\r\nplant invasions respond to and alter fire and post-fire plant\r\ncommunities and forest recovery at local and landscape scales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "author": [],
      "date": "`r Sys.Date()`",
      "contents": "\r\n\r\nNative plant communities across the globe are threatened by\r\nintroduced species that compete for resources and alter ecosystem\r\nfunctions. Environmental and biotic characteristics of a community can\r\ninfluence the success of an invading species. Productive communities are\r\noften thought to be more resistant to invasion because they more\r\ncompletely utilize available resources. Species with similar traits to\r\ninvaders are also thought to increase community resistance by having\r\ngreater niche overlap and competing more strongly for limited resources\r\nthan dissimilar species. However, the strength of resistance may depend\r\non the environmental characteristics of the community as well as\r\ncommunity functional traits.  Disturbances such as fire may increase\r\navailable resources and remove native competitors, potentially\r\nexacerbating invasion impacts. Understanding how community traits,\r\nenvironmental stress, and disturbance interact to influence invasion\r\nresistance is important for predicting and managing potential impacts\r\nassociated with introduced species.\r\nPast research with Dr. Meg Krawchuk & Dr. Becky Kerns, examined\r\nhow community traits, abiotic stress, and disturbance interact to\r\ninfluence invasion resistance in dry forest-mosaic landscapes using\r\nshort and long-term field observations and data from field\r\nexperiments.\r\nResearch Questions\r\nHow do biotic community factors such as productivity, diversity, and\r\nabove/below-ground functional traits influence invasion resistance?\r\n\r\nHow are resident-invader interactions influenced by environmental\r\ncondition (such as resource availability) and disturbances (fire)?\r\nVentenata\r\nIn eastern Oregon, a recently introduced Eurasian annual grass,\r\nVentenata dubia (commonly known as ventenata), is spreading\r\nrapidly across dry forests, meadows, and shrublands. Prior to the\r\nventenata invasion, many of these communities remained resistant to\r\ninvasion despite being exposed to numerous impactful introduced species\r\nincluding cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum. Little is known about\r\nventenata’s impacts on native plant communities, but its invasion into\r\nrare and previously uninvaded ecosystems is cause for alarm. Improving\r\nunderstanding of how environmental and plant community characteristics\r\ninfluence resistance to invasion could aid the development of adaptive\r\nmanagement and restoration strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
