### Welcome!
<br>I'm a PhD student researching plant invasions and wildfire at Oregon State University. I use field, remote sensing, and modeling techniques to investigate how plant traits and environmental characteristics influence plant community response to disturbances, including biological invasion and wildfire, at local and landscape-scales. My goals are to help develop co-produced, actionable science to inform more effective and efficient management actions and promote balanced ecosystems.
